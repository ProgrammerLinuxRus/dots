# My smiple config for qtile

Hi:)
first of all I would like to say that I was inspired by the DistroTube channel,

and wanted to do something similar but in my own way.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. Ð¡reate the necessary directories and copy the files into them

## Dependencies 

+ **alsa-utils**        *for volume module on bar*
+ **python-psutil**     *for cpu module on bar*
+ **erd-fonts**    *for icons*
+ **conky**        *for system monitor*
+ **nitrogen**     *for wallpapers*
  
To install on arch linux run the following commands:

~~~
sudo pacman -S alsa-utils python-psutil conky
~~~
and
~~~bash
yay -S nerd-fonts #or use another AUR helper
~~~
