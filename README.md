# My smiple config for qtile

Hi:)
first of all I would like to say that I was inspired by the DistroTube channel,

and wanted to do something similar but in my own way.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. Ð¡reate the necessary directories and copy the files into them

## Dependencies 

+ alsa-utils
+ python-psutil
+ nerd-fonts
+ conky
+ nitrogen *for wallpapers*
  
To install on arch linux run the following commands:

~~~
sudo pacman -S alsa-utils python-psutil conky
~~~
~~~bash
yay -S nerd-fonts #or use another AUR helper
~~~
